s4heading: "Life at the ringside / 5 unique stories"
s4body1: "5 unique stories about life at the ringside of domestic violence. Real people share real stories of growing up in a home where witnessing violence was the norm. They contemplate how the experiences have shaped them, and how they’ve learned to deal with PTSD and mental trauma.  Only by identifying the trauma, facing the memories, talking about them and going through them, can they slowly leave the ringside to the past."

s6heading: "A voice for the silenced"

s6body1: "Experiences of domestic violence are alarmingly common in Finland. One in three women and one in six men have faced violence in a relationship. Often, children in the family are also exposed to violence within the home.

Domestic violence can take many forms: it might be controlling behavior, or emotional, physical, digital, or financial abuse. Anyone, regardless of gender or family situation, can be a victim, a perpetrator, or exposed to violence.

To give a voice to the silent victims, we all must take action."

s6body2: "If you or someone you know is exposed to domestic violence, help is available. The Nollalinja helpline is open 24/7 at 0800 005 005. For emergency shelters, click here.

We also urge everyone reading this to sign a petition for a law amendment that would recognize a child as a victim in every situation where they witness violence. Sign the petition here."
