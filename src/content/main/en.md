s6heading: "A voice for the silenced"

s6body1: "Experiences of domestic violence are alarmingly common in Finland. One in three women and one in six men have faced violence in a relationship. Often, children in the family are also exposed to violence within the home.

Domestic violence can take many forms: it might be controlling behavior, or emotional, physical, digital, or financial abuse. Anyone, regardless of gender or family situation, can be a victim, a perpetrator, or exposed to violence.

To give a voice to the silent victims, we all must take action."

s6body2: "If you or someone you know is exposed to domestic violence, help is available. The Nollalinja helpline is open 24/7 at 0800 005 005. For emergency shelters,"
